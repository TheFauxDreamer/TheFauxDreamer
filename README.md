- 👋 Hi, I’m TheFauxDreamer
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, Creating, & "Designing"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, and maybe stuff like Swift
- 🔨 I'm usually creating little tools for myself or to help at work

It's all just for a bit of fun or to make my life (and hopefully others’) easier
